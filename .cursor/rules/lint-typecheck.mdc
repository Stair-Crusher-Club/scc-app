- Always run lint and type checks after modifying code to ensure code quality and prevent errors.
- Use the following commands in the project root:
  - `yarn lint` or `npm run lint` to check for code style and lint errors.
  - `yarn tsc --noEmit` or `npm run typecheck` to check for TypeScript type errors.
- Fix all reported issues before committing or opening a pull request.
- Run these checks locally before pushing to CI to save time and avoid build failures.
- If you add or update dependencies, re-run type checks to catch new type issues.
