# Desktop Web Application Requirements

## Overview
Create a desktop web application that reuses React Native components from the mobile app to build a search interface optimized for desktop screens.

## Screen Layout (1920x1080 resolution)
- **Left Panel (1/5 of screen width)**: SearchListView component
- **Right Panel (1/5 of screen width)**: PlaceDetailScreen (shown when a place is clicked)
- **Background (remaining 3/5)**: White background (future: map integration)

## Technical Requirements
1. Reuse existing React Native components where possible
2. Create new desktop-optimized screens using these components
3. Support desktop interactions (mouse, keyboard)
4. Run as a standalone web server on localhost

## Components to Reuse
- SearchListView (search results list)
- PlaceDetailScreen (place details)
- Other atomic components as needed

## Deployment
- Local development server on localhost
- Future: Production deployment for web access
